                <br>Personal Growth:
                <br>
                <br>1) Recognizing stress - I'd like to say I'm taking a day off because work has been stressful. Thats not the case. In fact, I don't get stressed. I see my coworkers getting stressed all the time. I find myself in situations where I know I should be stressed, yet it doesn't occur. It has its ups, but the detrimental part is when it comes to treating issues with a sense of urgency. It has gotten a lot better.
                <br>
                <br>2) Mental Strength - My mental strength, and my willpower are weak. Weaker than I would like it to be :D.
                <br>
                <br>3) Discipline - Stay disciplined for the gym, dance, cardio, stretching, cleaning, etc.
                <br>
                <br>4) Cooking - Only eat out once a week or biweekly even
                <br>
                <br>5) Budget!
