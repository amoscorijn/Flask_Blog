		    <small><p class="article-content">I took a day off work today. No particular reason. I just wanted a day off.
                <br>
                <br>A few days ago I tried to visit my site on my mobile phone, and realized that the images were messing up my word wraps.
                <br>
                <br>It should be good now. I still can't figure out the login/registration database and its a bit frustrating. For now I'll continue updating as usual.
                <br> 
                <br>To see what projects I am working on and personal goals I am working towards

		    <h4><a class="article-title" href="#">Installing Arch Linux</a></h4>
		    <small><p class="article-content"> Since I rarely play video games anymore, I decided to reformat my PC and completely set it up as a Linux machine. 
                <br>
                <br> I could have done a dualboot with Windows, but decided not to. Reason is that I wanted to fully immerse myself in Linux, and if I ever want to game again, to find a way to do it via Linux. Apparently Arch Linux is the most difficult distribution of Linux to install. Since I already have experience installing other distributions like CentOS, Ubuntu, Mint, OpenSUSE, and RedHat, it was not that difficult.
                <br>
                <br> Here I will outline the steps of my installation process.

                something vital to my learning... I barely even know how a computer works to begin with... Now THATS embarrassing... So instead of making an upside down pyramid
                like an idiot, its back to basics y'all - Hardware! 
                <br>
                <br>
                    I will be writing in my own words how I understand these key pieces of hardware, because being able to write it in my own language is the uhh, best way to learn something? Either that or I'll finally understand how a Pigeon feels pecking at random debris continuously believing that shit is food:
